# Hi there! 👋 I'm Sagar Sawant

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a **mathematician** with a passion for exploring the elegant intersections of **algebraic combinatorics** and **graph algorithms**. 🎓 I recently completed my **PhD in Mathematics**, where I delved into the fascinating world of distinguishing graphs using symmetric and quasisymmetric functions.

## 🌱 About Me
- 🧮 **Research Interests**: Algebraic Combinatorics, Graph Theory, Algorithms, and their beautiful applications.
- 🎶 Apart from math, I enjoy playing the **tabla** (I'm a Sangeet Visharad!) and listening to classical **Hindustani** and **Carnatic music**.
- 🥏 I love playing **ultimate frisbee** and board games like **Catan**, **Saboteur**, and **Agricola**.

## 📬 Get in Touch
Feel free to reach out to me for collaborations, discussions, or just a chat about math and music!
